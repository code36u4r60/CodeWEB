# Resources
    - A resource is a collection of objects havintg something in common:
        » people
        » blog articles
        » tweets
    - Resources can be Created, Read Updated and Deleted.
    These are called CRURD operations.
    - Resources are ReSTful. ReST is a stateless client-server protocol, often used for internet communication of data.

# Adding a new resource
    - Edit the routes.rb file
    - Add a resource route:
        » resources :resource_name
    - run bin/rake routes to verify that the new resource routes are Created

<# bin/rake routes

    - new, edit, show, and destroy are actions (methods) for the contacts resource that correspond to the Create, Update, Read, and Delete of CRURD
        » A controller for the contacts resource must be created that contains an defines methods for these actions.
    - creat corresponds to creating a new record in the contacts resouce.
        » A model must be made for contacts, which defines the field names and types for the database table backing the resource.

# Creating the controller
    - Use the command
        bin/rails generate controller <name_of_resource>
    - The controller name must match the resource name exctly.
    - This will generate a new file in the app/controllers
        directory called <name_of_resource>_controller.rb
        » For example, bin/rails generate controller contacts
            generate contacts_controller.rb
    - The controller class will be ContactsController, and will contain no properties or methods when created.

# Error messages
    - Navigating to localhost:3000/contacts/new results in the following exception:

    - This is telling you that there is no new method defined in the ContactsController class.
    - Adding the "new" method results in the following:
        |   Ver img3.PNG    |
        In other words, we must defne a view for contacts/new 

# The new contacts view
    - Creating a file named new.html.erb in the views/contacts directory clears the previous error.
    - If the content of the file is 
        <h1>New Contact... </h1>
        then navigating to localhost/3000/contacts/new gives this:
        New Contact...
    - We're getting there!
